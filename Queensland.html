  <h1>Outline</h1>
  <p>This is a collection of ideas for new rail projects in Queensland. The goal of these ideas is to improve Queensland's rail network.</p>

  <h2>Doomben Line extension</h2>

  <p>This would involve reopening the railway line between Doomben and Pinkenba, reviving the railway stations at Eagle Farm, Meeandah, and Pinkenba. The <q>Doomben Line</q> would become the <q>Pinkenba Line</q>.</p>
  <h2>Gold Coast line extension</h2>

  <p>The Gold Coast Line would be extended from Varsity Lakes to Coolangatta, with new stations at West Burleigh, Tallebudgera, Elanora, Tugun, Gold Coast Airport, Coolangatta.</p>
  <h2>Main Line electrification extension</h2>

  <p>The electrification on the Main Line would be extended beyond Rosewood in stages. The stages would be:<br/><ol><li>Rosewood to Laidley</li><br/><li>Laidley to Gatton</li><br/><li>Gatton to Toowoomba</li></ol></p>
  <p>This would provide the basis for the long-awaited Brisbane to Toowoomba Fast Rail.</p>
  <h2>Darling Downs passenger rail</h2>

  <p>This would involve restoring a basic level of regular passenger rail services around the Darling Downs. Potential routes would include:<br/><ul><li>Toowoomba - Millmerran</li><br/><li>Toowoomba - Warwick</li><br/><li>Warwick - Goondiwindi</li><br/><li>Toowoomba - Wallangarra</li><br/><li>Toowoomba - Stanthorpe</li><br/><li>Toowoomba - Dalby</li><br/><li>Toowoomba - Gatton</li><li>Toowoomba - Cecil Plains</li></ul></p>
  <p>These would use trains powered by renewable energy until full electrification can be provided. These renewably-powered trains could use hydrogen cells, batteries, or solar panels as a power source.</p>
  <p>The reintroduction of passenger services to Millmerran would require the former Millmerran line to be extended from its current railhead at Brookstead to Millmerran, so that particular service could be introduced later, being supplemented by a temporary Toowoomba - Pittsworth service which could even become permanent depending on demand.</p>
  <h2>Main & Southern lines dual-gauge conversion</h2>
  <p><b>Credit: Furness804</b></p>
  <p>The route from Corinda - Wallangarra would be converted from being solely 3'6" gauge to dual 3'6"/4'8.5" gauge with accompanying infrastructure modifications and upgrades being provided. This, in conjunction with reopening of the Main North line in New South Wales between Armidale - Wallangarra would provide a secondary rail connection between Queensland and New South Wales.</p>
  <h2>Cross River Rail Extension</h2>
  <p><b>Credit: Furness804</b></p>
  <p>A branch off of the Cross River Rail route would be built. It would break off between Roma Street and Exhibition, and it would join the North Coast Line at Strathpine. New stations would be built at: <ol><li>Kelvin Grove</li><br/><li>Newmarket (providing an interchange with the Ferny Grove line)</li><br/><li>Stafford</li><br/><li>Kedron</li><br/><li>Chermside</li><br/><li>Aspley</li><br/><li>Bridgeman Downs</li></ol></p>
