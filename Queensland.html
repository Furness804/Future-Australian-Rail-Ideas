  <p>This would involve reopening the railway line between Doomben and Pinkenba, reviving the railway stations at Eagle Farm, Meeandah, and Pinkenba. The <q>Doomben Line</q> would become the <q>Pinkenba Line</q>.</p>

  <p>The Gold Coast Line would be extended from Varsity Lakes to Tweed Heads (in New South Wales), with new stations at West Burleigh, Tallebudgera, Elanora, Tugun, Gold Coast Airport, Coolangatta, and Tweed Heads.</p>
