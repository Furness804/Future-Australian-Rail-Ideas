  <h1>Outline</h1>
  <p>This is a collection of ideas for new rail projects in Queensland. The goal of these ideas is to improve Queensland's rail network.</p>
  <hr/>
  <h1>Brisbane</h1>
  <p><i>This covers the area from the QLD/NSW border to the south, Gympie to the north, the ocean to the east, and the Great Dividing Range to the west.</i></p>
  <h2>Doomben Line extension</h2>

  <p>This would involve reopening the railway line between Doomben and Pinkenba, reviving the railway stations at Eagle Farm, Meeandah, and Pinkenba. The <q>Doomben Line</q> would become the <q>Pinkenba Line</q>.</p>
  <h2>Gold Coast line extension</h2>

  <p>The Gold Coast Line would be extended from Varsity Lakes to Coolangatta, with new stations at West Burleigh, Tallebudgera, Elanora, Tugun, Gold Coast Airport, Coolangatta.</p>
  <hr/>
  <h1>Darling Downs</h1>
  <p><i>This covers the area from the Great Dividing Range in the east, Dalby in the west, the QLD/NSW border in the south, and Yarraman in the north.</i></p>
  <h2>Darling Downs passenger rail</h2>

  <p>This would involve restoring a basic level of regular passenger rail services around the Darling Downs. Potential routes would include:<br/><ul><li>Toowoomba - Millmerran</li><br/><li>Toowoomba - Warwick</li><br/><li>Warwick - Goondiwindi</li><br/><li>Toowoomba - Wallangarra</li><br/><li>Toowoomba - Stanthorpe</li><br/><li>Toowoomba - Dalby</li><br/><li>Toowoomba - Gatton</li></ul></p>
